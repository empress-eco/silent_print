## About Silent Print

Silent Print is a user-friendly application designed to significantly enhance your printing experience by automating the entire process. It's an ideal tool for businesses with multiple printers, print formats or those that rely heavily on printing, such as restaurants and offices. 

### Key Features

- **Device Flexibility**: Print from any device, including those not connected to printers.

Silent Print leverages the powerful [Webapp Hardware Bridge](https://github.com/imTigger/webapp-hardware-bridge) to facilitate seamless communication between your web application and hardware.
